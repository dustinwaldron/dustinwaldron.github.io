[{"content":"Background Years ago, I started my development journey learning javascript, NodeJS and React. My first project was, like others, building a Pokedex App using the PokeAPI.

But too often, those lessons stay hidden inside project folders, Slack threads, or our own heads.\nStarting this blog was my way to change that — to document my projects, share what I learn, and hopefully inspire others to build cool things.\n1. Document Projects Writing about a project forces you to clarify your thinking. It’s easy to move on to the next shiny idea, but documentation helps future-you (and others) revisit, maintain, and extend your work.\n2. Share Knowledge Every engineer learns differently, and your perspective might be the one that helps someone finally understand a tricky concept. Sharing knowledge strengthens the community and makes tech more accessible.\n3. Inspire Builders We all got into this field because we love building. When I read other engineers’ blogs, I get inspired to try new stacks, frameworks, or even just better ways of thinking. I hope this blog does the same for someone else.\nHow I Built This Blog: Hugo + GitHub Pages If you’ve been thinking about starting your own tech blog, you can do it in an afternoon. Here’s the path I took to get this one up and running.\nStep 1: Install Hugo Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It’s fast, flexible, and perfect for developer blogs.\n# for mac brew install hugo # or for Windows choco install hugo-extended Check your install:\nhugo version Step 2: Create a New Site hugo new site my-tech-blog cd my-tech-blog Step 3: Add a Theme Pick a theme you like from themes.gohugo.io.\nExample:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod echo \u0026#39;theme = \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hugo.toml Step 4: Add Your First Post hugo new posts/your-awesome-post.md Open the file in your editor, write your first post and save.\nStep 5: Test Locally hugo server Then visit http://localhost:1313 to preview your blog.\nStep 6: Push to GitHub Initialize a repo and push:\ngit init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-tech-blog.git git push -u origin main Step 7: Deploy with GitHub Pages You can deploy using a GitHub Actions workflow:\nCreate .github/workflows/hugo.yml:\nname: Build and deploy on: push: branches: - main # Set a branch to deploy pull_request: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-24.04 concurrency: group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.119.0\u0026#39; # extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 if: github.ref == \u0026#39;refs/heads/main\u0026#39; with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public Push the workflow, and your blog will auto-deploy to https://yourusername.github.io/my-tech-blog/.\nFinal Thoughts Blogging as a developer isn’t just about writing — it’s about creating a living record of your journey.\nIt’s a way to give back, stay accountable, and connect with others who love to build.\nIf you’ve ever thought, “I should start a blog,” — take this as your nudge.\nStart small, share your process, and let others learn alongside you.\nHappy building!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-started-a-tech-blog/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"why-i-started-this-blog\"\u003eWhy I Started This Blog\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs engineers, we spend a lot of time building, experimenting, and solving problems.
