<h2 id="current-focus">Current Focus<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#current-focus">#</a></h2>
<p>I am currently focused on deepening my capabilities as a senior staff software engineer by expanding my expertise in software architecture, DevOps practices, and practical applications of AI. Much of this growth comes from actively experimenting with new technologies and documenting what I learn through blogging and technical writing. I use these projects as a way to validate architectural patterns, explore emerging tooling, and refine my ability to build scalable, resilient systems. DevOps remains a major focus area, particularly around automation, observability, and platform-level engineering. I am also investing significant time into understanding how AI can enhance developer workflows and accelerate system design. Beyond self-driven learning, I enjoy applying these skills to help organizations untangle complex technical problems and modernize their systems. I regularly partner with teams to evaluate architecture decisions, improve development processes, and guide long-term technical direction. This combination of hands-on project work and real-world consulting helps sharpen both my technical depth and my ability to lead through influence. Ultimately, my current focus is on evolving into a stronger architectural thinker and a more impactful technologist.</p>
