## 👋 Hi, I’m Dustin.

I'm a polyglot full-stack Senior Staff Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend, infrastructure, and system optimization, with experience spanning multiple industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. Currently at BD, I'm contributing to the development of medical workflow applications, focusing on API design, cloud integration, and improving system performance and reliability. At JPMorgan Chase, I led full-stack efforts to optimize AWS infrastructure, cutting costs by 40%, and built mobile and web solutions that enhanced customer experiences. I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including Go, Java, React, TypeScript, Python, Swift, AWS, and Kubernetes, which allows me to bring a well-rounded, adaptable approach to software development. I'm passionate about doing the right thing—prioritizing long-term scalability, system resiliency, and team optimization. I aim to drive performance, reduce costs, and ensure efficient engineering practices while mentoring engineers, promoting best practices, and fostering collaboration to deliver impactful solutions. After work, you can find me dabbling in many hobbies ranging from gardening, woodworking, painting, tinkering with technology, and cheering on Cleveland sports.

## Current Focus
I am currently focused on deepening my capabilities as a senior staff software engineer by expanding my expertise in software architecture, DevOps practices, and practical applications of AI. Much of this growth comes from actively experimenting with new technologies and documenting what I learn through blogging and technical writing. I use these projects as a way to validate architectural patterns, explore emerging tooling, and refine my ability to build scalable, resilient systems. DevOps remains a major focus area, particularly around automation, observability, and platform-level engineering. I am also investing significant time into understanding how AI can enhance developer workflows and accelerate system design. Beyond self-driven learning, I enjoy applying these skills to help organizations untangle complex technical problems and modernize their systems. I regularly partner with teams to evaluate architecture decisions, improve development processes, and guide long-term technical direction. This combination of hands-on project work and real-world consulting helps sharpen both my technical depth and my ability to lead through influence. Ultimately, my current focus is on evolving into a stronger architectural thinker and a more impactful technologist.
